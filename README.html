# YiZ Planner - AI-Powered Skill & Habit Development Platform

## Foreword

This document presents YiZ Planner, our NUS Orbital 2025 project submission. We have developed a comprehensive cross-platform mobile application that revolutionizes skill acquisition and habit formation through AI-powered personalized learning plans and community collaboration. This README provides a detailed technical analysis of our implementation, architectural decisions, development methodology, and quality assurance processes.

---

## 1. Project Overview

### Aim & Motivation

**Problem Statement**: The skill and habit development landscape faces critical challenges that prevent successful learning outcomes:

- **High Abandonment Rates**: Research shows 92% of people abandon their learning goals within the first few months
- **Burnout from Poor Pacing**: Generic learning plans don't adapt to individual capacity, leading to overwhelming difficulty spikes
- **Lack of Specialized Guidance**: Learners have skill-specific questions but no expert guidance available
- **Generic Motivation Systems**: One-size-fits-all notifications and reminders lose effectiveness quickly
- **Isolation in Learning**: No coaching support during challenging phases when users are most likely to quit

**Real-World Context**: Traditional learning and habit-building applications treat users as data points rather than individuals with varying capacities, schedules, and learning styles. The missing piece is intelligent, adaptive coaching that understands both domain expertise and individual learning journeys.

### Vision

YiZ Planner envisions becoming the definitive platform for structured personal development, where:
- AI-powered personalized learning eliminates the guesswork from skill acquisition
- Community-driven knowledge sharing accelerates learning through peer collaboration
- Adaptive progress tracking prevents burnout while maintaining optimal challenge levels
- Social interactions create accountability and motivation networks
- Data-driven insights help users understand their learning patterns and optimize their growth

### User Stories

#### Core Users
**As a university student**, I want to systematically learn programming languages with structured daily tasks so that I can build a strong foundation for my computer science degree.

**As a working professional**, I want to develop new skills with flexible schedules that adapt to my workload so that I can advance my career without overwhelming myself.

**As a self-learner**, I want access to AI-generated learning plans and community-shared knowledge so that I can learn efficiently without expensive courses.

#### Advanced Users (Extensions)
**As an experienced learner**, I want to share my custom learning plans with the community so that I can help others while building my reputation as a subject matter expert.

**As a learning community moderator**, I want to curate and enhance community-shared skills with custom tasks so that the platform maintains high-quality content.

**As a data-conscious user**, I want detailed analytics about my learning patterns and progress so that I can optimize my study habits and identify areas for improvement.

## 2. Technical Architecture & Design

### Architecture Pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Our system follows a clear MVC architecture with modern adaptations:

- **Model**: MongoDB collections (Users, Skills, Habits, SharedSkills) with PyMongo repositories handling data persistence
- **View**: React Native screens and components managing UI presentation and user interactions
- **Controller**: Flask API routes coordinating between business logic services and data repositories

## 3. Feature Implementation Deep Dive

### 3.1 User Authentication System

#### Description
Secure user registration, login, and session management with JWT-based authentication and password encryption.

#### Implementation Philosophy

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
// MongoDB Users Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: String (unique, indexed),
  email: String (unique, indexed),
  password_hash: String (bcrypt with 12 rounds),
  profile: {
    display_name: String,
    avatar_url: String
  },
  streaks: {
    current_login: Number,
    longest_login: Number,
    last_login: ISODate
  },
  created_at: ISODate,
  updated_at: ISODate
}
```

**Security Implementation**:
```python
# Password hashing with bcrypt
def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12))

# JWT token generation with 7-day expiry
def generate_token(user_id: str) -> str:
    payload = {
        'user_id': user_id,
        'iat': datetime.utcnow(),
        'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=7)
    }
    return jwt.encode(payload, JWT_SECRET_KEY, algorithm='HS256')
```

**Architectural Choices**:
- JWT tokens stored in AsyncStorage for session persistence
- AuthContext provider wraps entire app for global state management
- Automatic token verification on app launch with fallback to login screen

#### Implementation Challenges

**Challenge 1: Token Expiry Handling**
- **Problem**: Users experienced unexpected logouts when tokens expired
- **Solution**: Implemented automatic token refresh with graceful fallback to login screen
- **Code**: Added token verification interceptor in Axios configuration

**Challenge 2: Cross-Platform State Synchronization**
- **Problem**: Auth state inconsistencies between AsyncStorage and React Context
- **Solution**: Centralized auth state management with useEffect hooks for persistence

### 3.2 AI Plan Generation System

#### Description
Intelligent 30-day learning plan generation using OpenRouter AI with smart caching and local fallback templates.

#### Implementation Philosophy

**Algorithm Design**:
```python
class AIService:
    _plan_cache = {}  # In-memory cache for generated plans
    _last_api_call = 0
    _api_cooldown = 60  # Rate limiting: 1 minute between calls
    
    @staticmethod
    async def generate_structured_plan(topic: str, plan_type: str = "skill"):
        # 1. Check cache first (O(1) lookup)
        cache_key = f"{topic.lower().strip()}_{plan_type}"
        if cache_key in AIService._plan_cache:
            return AIService._plan_cache[cache_key]
        
        # 2. Rate limiting check
        current_time = time.time()
        if current_time - AIService._last_api_call < AIService._api_cooldown:
            return AIService._generate_local_plan(topic, plan_type)
        
        # 3. Try AI service with fallback
        try:
            plan = await AIService._generate_ai_plan(topic, plan_type)
            AIService._plan_cache[cache_key] = plan
            AIService._last_api_call = current_time
            return plan
        except Exception:
            return AIService._generate_local_plan(topic, plan_type)
```

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
// Skills Collection - Curriculum Structure
{
  curriculum: [
    {
      day: 1,
      title: "Introduction to Python Basics",
      tasks: [
        "Set up Python development environment",
        "Learn basic syntax and variables",
        "Write your first Python program"
      ],
      resources: [
        {
          title: "Python Official Tutorial",
          url: "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/",
          type: "documentation"
        }
      ],
      estimated_time: 120, // minutes
      difficulty: "beginner"
    }
    // ... 29 more days
  ]
}
```

**Prompt Engineering Strategy**:
```python
def construct_ai_prompt(topic: str, difficulty: str) -> str:
    return f"""
    Create a comprehensive 30-day learning plan for: {topic}
    Difficulty level: {difficulty}
    
    Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
    {{
      "curriculum": [
        {{
          "day": 1,
          "title": "Day 1 title",
          "tasks": ["task1", "task2", "task3"],
          "resources": [{{"title": "resource", "url": "url", "type": "type"}}],
          "estimated_time": 120,
          "difficulty": "{difficulty}"
        }}
      ]
    }}
    
    Requirements:
    - Exactly 30 days
    - Progressive difficulty increase
    - 3-5 practical tasks per day
    - 2-3 relevant resources per day
    - Realistic time estimates (60-180 minutes)
    """
```

#### Implementation Challenges

**Challenge 1: API Rate Limiting**
- **Problem**: OpenRouter API had usage limits causing failures during testing
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent rate limiting with 60-second cooldown and local template fallbacks
- **Impact**: Achieved 100% plan generation success rate

**Challenge 2: JSON Response Parsing**
- **Problem**: AI sometimes returned malformed JSON or additional text
- **Solution**: Added robust JSON extraction using regex patterns and validation schemas
- **Code**: `json.loads(re.search(r'\{.*\}', response, re.DOTALL).group())`

**Challenge 3: Template Quality**
- **Problem**: Local fallback templates were too generic
- **Solution**: Created 8 category-specific templates (Programming, Languages, Fitness, Creative Arts) with realistic progressions

### 3.3 Social Platform & Community Sharing

#### Description
Complete social ecosystem enabling users to share learning plans, discover community content, and engage through likes, comments, and ratings.

#### Implementation Philosophy

**Database Design for Social Features**:
```javascript
// SharedSkills Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  original_skill_id: ObjectId, // Reference to user's skill
  shared_by: ObjectId, // User who shared
  title: String,
  description: String, // Community description
  tags: [String], // Searchable tags
  category: String,
  difficulty: String,
  curriculum: Array, // Copy of original curriculum
  visibility: String, // "public" | "unlisted"
  stats: {
    likes: Number,
    downloads: Number,
    rating_sum: Number,
    rating_count: Number,
    trending_score: Number // Calculated field
  },
  created_at: ISODate
}

// Interactions Collection (Normalized approach)
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  user_id: ObjectId,
  target_id: ObjectId, // SharedSkill ID
  target_type: String, // "shared_skill"
  interaction_type: String, // "like" | "download" | "rating"
  value: Mixed, // Boolean for likes, Number for ratings
  created_at: ISODate
}
```

**Trending Algorithm**:
```python
def calculate_trending_score(skill_data: dict) -> float:
    """
    Trending score algorithm based on engagement and recency
    Formula: (likes * 1.0 + downloads * 2.0 + comments * 1.5) / age_factor
    """
    now = datetime.utcnow()
    created_at = skill_data.get('created_at', now)
    age_hours = (now - created_at).total_seconds() / 3600
    
    # Decay factor: newer content gets higher scores
    age_factor = max(1.0, age_hours / 24)  # Decay over days
    
    engagement_score = (
        skill_data.get('stats', {}).get('likes', 0) * 1.0 +
        skill_data.get('stats', {}).get('downloads', 0) * 2.0 +
        skill_data.get('stats', {}).get('comments', 0) * 1.5
    )
    
    return engagement_score / age_factor
```

**Search Implementation**:
```python
# MongoDB text search with multiple criteria
def search_shared_skills(query: str, filters: dict, page: int = 1, limit: int = 20):
    pipeline = [
        # Text search stage
        {
            "$match": {
                "$text": {"$search": query},
                **filters  # category, difficulty filters
            }
        },
        # Add relevance score
        {
            "$addFields": {
                "relevance_score": {"$meta": "textScore"}
            }
        },
        # Sort by relevance and trending
        {
            "$sort": {
                "relevance_score": -1,
                "stats.trending_score": -1
            }
        },
        # Pagination
        {"$skip": (page - 1) * limit},
        {"$limit": limit}
    ]
    return list(db.shared_skills.aggregate(pipeline))
```

#### Implementation Challenges

**Challenge 1: Real-time Interaction Updates**
- **Problem**: Like counts and interactions weren't updating in real-time across users
- **Solution**: Implemented optimistic UI updates with server reconciliation
- **Code**: Frontend immediately updates UI, then syncs with backend response

**Challenge 2: Duplicate Interaction Prevention**
- **Problem**: Users could like the same skill multiple times due to race conditions
- **Solution**: Created unique compound index on (user_id, target_id, interaction_type)
- **MongoDB**: `db.interactions.createIndex({"user_id": 1, "target_id": 1, "interaction_type": 1}, {unique: true})`

**Challenge 3: Search Performance**
- **Problem**: Text search was slow with large datasets
- **Solution**: Implemented compound indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Performance**: Reduced search time from 800ms to <100ms

### 3.4 Analytics Dashboard

#### Description
Comprehensive analytics system providing users with insights into their learning patterns, progress tracking, and activity visualizations.

#### Implementation Philosophy

**Data Aggregation Strategy**:
```python
class StatsService:
    @staticmethod
    def get_comprehensive_stats(user_id: str) -> dict:
        """
        Aggregates user statistics from multiple collections
        Uses MongoDB aggregation pipeline for efficiency
        """
        pipeline = [
            {"$match": {"user_id": ObjectId(user_id)}},
            {
                "$group": {
                    "_id": None,
                    "total_skills": {"$sum": 1},
                    "completed_skills": {
                        "$sum": {"$cond": [{"$eq": ["$status", "completed"]}, 1, 0]}
                    },
                    "avg_progress": {"$avg": "$progress.completion_percentage"},
                    "total_study_time": {"$sum": "$progress.total_time_spent"}
                }
            }
        ]
        return list(db.skills.aggregate(pipeline))[0]
```

**Chart Data Processing**:
```javascript
// Frontend chart data transformation
const processActivityData = (rawData) => {
  const last30Days = Array.from({length: 30}, (_, i) => {
    const date = new Date();
    date.setDate(date.getDate() - i);
    return {
      date: date.toISOString().split('T')[0],
      activity: 0
    };
  }).reverse();
  
  // Merge with actual data
  rawData.forEach(day => {
    const index = last30Days.findIndex(d => d.date === day.date);
    if (index !== -1) {
      last30Days[index].activity = day.completed_tasks;
    }
  });
  
  return last30Days;
};
```

#### Implementation Challenges

**Challenge 1: Performance with Large Datasets**
- **Problem**: Statistics calculation was slow for users with many skills/habits
- **Solution**: Implemented MongoDB aggregation pipelines and caching
- **Result**: Reduced response time from 2.5s to <200ms

**Challenge 2: Real-time Data Updates**
- **Problem**: Statistics weren't updating immediately after user actions
- **Solution**: Used React's `useFocusEffect` to refresh data when screen gains focus
- **Code**: `useFocusEffect(useCallback(() => { fetchStats(); }, []))`

## 4. Professional Development Process

### Version Control Strategy

**Git Workflow**:
- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code, protected from direct pushes
- **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for feature development
- **Feature Branches**: Individual features developed in isolation (`feature/social-platform`, `feature/analytics-dashboard`)
- **Pull Request Process**: All changes require PR approval and merge into develop before reaching main

**Branch Protection Rules**:
```bash
# Example branch protection configuration
git config branch.main.mergeOptions --no-ff
git config branch.develop.mergeOptions --no-ff
```

**Commit Convention**:
```
feat: add social sharing functionality
fix: resolve authentication token expiry  
docs: update API documentation
test: add unit tests for skill service
refactor: optimize database queries
```

### Issue Tracking & Project Management

**GitHub Issues Usage**:
- Bug reports with reproducible steps and environment details
- Feature requests linked to user stories
- Technical debt tracking for code improvements
- Release planning with milestone assignments

**Development Methodology**:
- **Sprint Duration**: 2-week iterations
- **Planning**: Weekly planning sessions with feature prioritization
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer review for all pull requests
- **Testing**: Feature completion requires corresponding test coverage

### Security Measures

**Environment Variable Management**:
```bash
# Backend .env (never committed)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET_KEY=randomly_generated_256_bit_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=encrypted_api_key
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=service_specific_key

# Frontend .env (never committed)  
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=production_url_only
```

**Additional Security Measures**:
- API keys stored in environment variables, never in code
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiry and secure storage
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- CORS configuration limiting frontend origins
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
