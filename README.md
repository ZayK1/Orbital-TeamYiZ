**YiZ Plannar**
YiZ Plannar is a mobile application built with React Native that helps users learn new skills by generating AI-assisted learning plans.

**Overview**
The goal of YiZ Planner is to make skill acquisition simple and guided. Users can log in, describe the skill they want to learn (e.g., "playing guitar"), and instantly receive a tailored learning plan generated by AI.


**Features**
User Authentication
      Login & Register pages
      Password authentication via MongoDB

Home Page
  		Simple and intuitive UI
  		Text input block for entering a desired skill

AI Integration
  		Connects to **OpenRouter API** to generate learning plans
  		Retrieves and displays AI-generated content on the frontend

Database
User information and skill plans are stored in a MongoDB database


**Proof of Concept**
Working Demo Includes:
- React Native frontend with working UI for login, register, and home page.
- MongoDB backend for storing and authenticating user credentials.
- API call to **OpenRouter** based on user's input (e.g., "learn guitar").
- AI-generated plan successfully retrieved and displayed in the app.

Sample Flow:
1. User logs in or registers.
2. User types a skill like "playing guitar" on the home screen.
3. The app sends a request to the OpenRouter API.
4. The AI generates a personalized learning plan.
5. The result is returned and displayed on the app screen.
