# YiZ Planner  
**AI-Assisted Learning Plan Generator**

---

## 🧠 Overview  
YiZ Planner is a mobile application built with **React Native** that aims to simplify and guide skill acquisition by generating AI-assisted learning plans.  

Users can log in, describe a skill they wish to learn (e.g., _"playing guitar"_), and instantly receive a tailored learning plan generated by AI.

## 🚀 Features  

### 🧑‍💻 User Authentication
- Login & Register pages  
- Password authentication via MongoDB  

### 🏠 Home Page
- Simple and intuitive UI  
- Text input for entering a desired skill  

### 🤖 AI Integration
- Connects to the **OpenRouter API** to generate learning plans  
- Retrieves and displays AI-generated content on the frontend  

### 🗄️ Database
- User information and skill plans are stored in a **MongoDB** database  

---

## ✅ Proof of Concept (POC)  
Our working demo includes the following functionalities:

- **React Native Frontend**: A functional UI for login, registration, and the home page  
- **MongoDB Backend**: Stores and authenticates user credentials  
- **API Integration**: Successful API call to OpenRouter based on user input (e.g., _"learn guitar"_)  
- **AI-Generated Plan Display**: AI-generated plans are successfully retrieved and displayed within the app  

---

## 🔁 Sample Flow  
1. The user logs in or registers  
2. The user types a skill (e.g., _"playing guitar"_) on the home screen  
3. The app sends a request to the **OpenRouter API**  
4. The AI generates a personalized learning plan  
5. The result is returned and displayed on the app screen

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

### 🔹 Frontend
- **React Native** (with Expo)
- JavaScript  
- React Navigation (Stack & Tab Navigators)  
- React Context API (Authentication state)  
- `axios` (HTTP client)  
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`  
- `lucide-react-native` (icons)  
- `expo-router` (Routing)

### 🔹 Backend
- **Python** (Flask)  
- MongoDB (via `pymongo`)  
- `bcrypt` for password hashing  
- `requests`, `flask-cors`, `python-dotenv`  

### 🔹 AI Integration
- **OpenRouter API** for generating 30-day learning plans

## 🏗️ Codebase Structure & Architecture  
YiZ Planner follows a classic **client-server architecture**:

- The **React Native frontend** (built with Expo) provides the UI and handles user interactions  
- The **Flask backend API** manages authentication and AI plan generation  
- The backend connects to **MongoDB Atlas** and the **OpenRouter API** to store data and generate plans

## 🌐 Deployed App  
You can access the deployed frontend at:  
🔗 [https://orbital-team-viz-frontend.vercel.app/](https://orbital-team-viz-frontend.vercel.app/)

> **Note:** The "Generate Plan" feature may not work on the deployed app due to Render's free trial memory limit.  
> A "Sample Plan" button has been added to preview how a plan is generated for any skill.  
> The full "Generate Plan" functionality works locally.
