## 🛠️ **Testing the Feature**

### **With Backend Running:**
If your backend is running on `http://192.168.0.116:8080`, the app will connect to real API endpoints and show actual community data.

### **Without Backend (Demo Mode):**
If the backend isn't available, the app automatically falls back to **sample data** so you can still test all the functionality:
- Sample skills with realistic data
- Sample trending content
- Sample popular skills
- All interactions work (like, download, search, filter)

## 🎨 **UI/UX Features**

- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for mobile screens
- **Smooth Animations** - Heart animations, loading states, transitions
- **Clean Interface** - Material Design icons and consistent styling
- **Loading States** - Proper loading indicators and empty states
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks when API is unavailable

## 🔄 **Real-time Features** (When Backend is Available)

- **Live Notifications** - Real-time updates for likes and downloads
- **WebSocket Integration** - Instant updates across the app
- **Engagement Counters** - Live updating like/download counts

## 📊 **Performance Features**

- **Debounced Search** - Optimized search performance (500ms delay)
- **Infinite Scroll** - Smooth pagination with 20 items per page
- **Caching** - Smart caching of search results and trending data
- **Lazy Loading** - Components load as needed

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If the Discover tab doesn't appear:**
1. Make sure you've saved all files
2. Restart the Metro bundler: `npm start`
3. Reload the app in your emulator/device

### **If you see "No skills available":**
- This is normal if the backend isn't running
- The app will show sample data for demonstration
- All features still work with sample data

### **If search/filters don't work:**
- Check the console for any JavaScript errors
